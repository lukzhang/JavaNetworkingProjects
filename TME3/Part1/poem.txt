1. CUPCAKE
They put me in the oven to bake.
Me, a deprived and miserable cake.
Feeling the heat, I started to bubble.
Watching the others, I knew I was in trouble.

They opened the door and I started my life.
Frosting me with a silver knife,
Decorating me with candy jewels.
The rest of my batch looked like fools.

Lifting me up, she took off my wrapper.
Feeling the breeze, I wanted to slap her.
Opening her mouth with shiny teeth inside,
This was the day this cupcake died.

2. WAITER
Dining with his older daughter
Dad forgot to order water.
Daughter quickly called the waiter.
Waiter said he’d bring it later.
So she waited, did the daughter,
Till the waiter brought her water.
When he poured it for her later,
Which one would you call the waiter?

3. GROWING
The grown-ups say I am growing tall
And that my clothes are growing small.
Can clothes grow small?
I always think
That things grow big
Or else they shrink.
But did they shrink
Or did I grow
Or did we both change?
I do not know

4. RABBIT
A rabbit
Bit
A little bit
An itty-bitty
Little bit of beet
Then bit
By bit
He bit
Because he liked the taste of it

5. SHARKS
The thing about a shark is teeth,
One row above, one row beneath.

Now take a close look. Do you find
It has another row behind?

Still closer—here, I will hold your hat:
Has it a third row behind that?

Now look in and...Look out! Oh my,
I will never know now! Well, goodbye.

6. POND
Everyone grumbled. The sky was grey.
We had nothing to do and nothing to say.
We were nearing the end of a dismal day,
And then there seemed to be nothing beyond,
Then
Daddy fell into the pond!

And everyone's face grew merry and bright,
And Timothy danced for sheer delight.
"Give me the camera, quick, oh quick!
He's crawling out of the duckweed!" Click!

Then the gardener suddenly slapped his knee,
And doubled up, shaking silently,
And the ducks all quacked as if they were daft,
And it sounded as if the old drake laughed.
Oh, there wasn't a thing that didn't respond
When
Daddy Fell into the pond!
